Framework Used :  Laravel 5.8 (PHP 7.1)

I tried to download  jsonl file as input file using AWS SDK but it alwyas giving error Invalid Access Key Id, so thats why i'm using guzzle http request for downloading jsonl when program run for the first time.

All output file was store in folder storage/app. 

It is Laravel Console Application File, to run it just type  php artisan command:name then the application will start automatically.
Command File was stored in app/Console/Command with OrderData.php then all classes that contain all functionality were stored in app/Console/Library. Several package for file format converter are used.
